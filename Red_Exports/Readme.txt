To make the screensize correct on windows, you have to open the program then, with the program focused, hold the windows key and press left or right. This will show the window, then you can re-size it or make it fullscreen again. If you don't do this then the screen will be cut off. 

This is a godot engine bug and I can't fix it but it should be fixed in a month or so.
